LIBS2ML: A Library for Scalable Second Order Machine Learning Algorithms
===========================================================================


## About LIBS2ML
LIBS2ML is a library based on scalable second order learning algorithms for solving large-scale problems, i.e., big data problems in machine learning. LIBS2ML has been developed using MEX files, i.e., C++ with MATLAB/Octave interface to take the advantage of both the worlds, i.e., faster learning using C++ and easy I/O using MATLAB/Octave. Most of the available libraries are either in MATLAB/Python/R which are very slow and not suitable for large-scale learning, or are in C/C++ which does not have easy ways to take input and display results. So, LIBS2ML is a completely unique due to its focus on the scalable second order methods -- the hot research topic -- and being based on MEX files. Thus, it provides researchers a comprehensive environment to evaluate their ideas and it also provides machine learning practitioners an effective tool to deal with the large-scale learning problems. LIBS2ML is an open-source, highly efficient, extensible, scalable, readable, portable and easy to use library. The library can be downloaded from the URL: https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/LIBS2ML.

## Installation
LIBS2ML works on MATLAB/Octave so it is platform independent and easy to install.
Download the latest version of the library from the following URL: https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/LIBS2ML

1. Prerequisite
    + MATLAB/Octave with compatiable C++ Compiler. 
You can check if your MATLAB/Octave has compatible complier or not using command ``mex -setup C++" on MATLAB/Octave command prompt. If you see some compliers as output that means your ready to go, otherwise (in MATLAB) you will see a link in the output to find the compatiable c++ compliers, so follow that link and install the required compliers.

2. Compile the source files:
    + Run `run_this_first.m' MATLAB script which will add the folders to the path.
    + Run the `make.m' MATLAB script which compiles the source code.

Now the library is ready to use. You can look at ``Quick Start Example" section.



## Quick Start Example
Here we provide an example of using LIBS2ML. For this we use MATLAB script ``exp_run.m" which uses ``mushroom.mat" dataset, which is present in ``data" folder, and sets some values to different parameters which can be tuned depending upon the problem and the solver. This compares the selected solvers for their convergence against time and accuracy. All required datasets can be downloaded from [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/) website and need to be in matlab format (can be converted using LIBSVM library).
- First Run `run_this_first.m' MATLAB script, if not done earlier, which will add the folders to the path.
- `exp_run.m', which is MATLAB driver script for running the experiments (or you can run other readymade driver script or modify the existing ones).

The experimental results for running demo the script with mushroom dataset:

## Extension
LIBS2ML is designed in a modular fashion and problem, solver, driver script and I/O are all kept separate. We can easily extend the library by adding more problems, solvers and even can change the input and output (display of results) very easily, with a little change. We can extend the lirary in following ways:

+ Add more problems
    1. For this, you need define a problem class which defines gradient, Hessian and other necessary informatioin.
    2. Include the file in MEX ``interface.cpp" file
    3. Define an enumeration for the problem in ``helpers.h" header file.
    4. Add clauses for the new class in the MEX ``interface.cpp" file, just like other existing classes.
    5. Specify the problem class in the MATLAB driver script.

+ Add more methods
    1. For this, you need define a method class which defines the learning algorithm for the method.
    2. Include the file in MEX ``interface.cpp" file
    3. Define an enumeration for the method in ``helpers.h" header file.
    4. Add clauses for the new method in the MEX ``interface.cpp" file, just like other existing classes.
    5. Specify the method class in the MATLAB driver script.

+ Change I/O:
    1. For changing the output, i.e, graphs you need to change the ``plot_graph.m" MATLAB file.
    2. For changing the input format for the data, you need to change MEX ``interface.cpp" file. But remember, all the methods/problems need to be changed according to the data format.
